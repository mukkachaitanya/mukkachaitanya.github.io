      <description>Hi Everyone!
The first week of my internship IISc as a project trainee has ended. There was some exciting work this week. We completed introduction to Clay Codes and moved forward to work with setting up Hadoop.
Setting up Hadoop came with various hurdles. There weren&amp;rsquo;t many good tutorials online which talked about developmemt setup of hadoop. Build dependecies created serious problems on Ubuntu 18.04. Spent more than a day to figure out it&amp;rsquo;s the distribution&amp;rsquo;s issue.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I would be writing this blog series to document my internship at Code and Design Lab, IISc.
The internship came out to me as a surprise as Dr.P.V.Kumar replied to my mail which was over a month old and I had to have a interview on the day my semester exams ended. Luckily I could do well at the unprepared interview, taken by Myna Vajha et al., and well got selected for the internship.</description>
